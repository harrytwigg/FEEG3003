\section{Aim}

The aim of this project is to synthesize realistic human singing, using DDSP, with modifiable latent space parameters.

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build a functioning machine learning model that can synthesize human singing with modifiable latent space parameters (F0 and Z).
    \item Testing how accurate and adaptable the DDSP model is at synthesizing singing using several different inferencing tests, these validate that any created model behaves inline with the original DDSP model\cite{OriginalDDSP}, and would be useful in future applications. They are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Almost identical resynthesis of the same song, using the same latent space parameters, and using the same artist as was used in the model's training dataset.
        \item Indepedent control of the latent parameters loudness and fundamental frequency (F0).
        \item Ensuring the words in model resynthesis are pronounced correctly (i.e. no babling or other audible errors).
        \item Ensuring the model can be trained in a reasonable amount of time, and inferred in at least real-time.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Derive constructive recommendations for future research based on past research and the results of this paper.
\end{enumerate}
