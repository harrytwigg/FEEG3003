\section{Aim}

This paper aims to evaluate the many approaches to music sound synthesis, with an aim to build on the most promising approach further, applying it to a music sound synthesis problem, demonstrating its effectiveness.

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To evaluate existing approaches to vocal audio signal encoding and sound synthesis using deep learning methods.
    \item Build on the best of the existing methods of vocal audio signal encoding and sound synthesis, validating and demonstrating the applicability of the proposed approach to the music sound synthesis problem.
    \item Derive constructive reccomendations for future research based on the research undertaken.
\end{enumerate}
