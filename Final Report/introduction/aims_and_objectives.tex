\section{Aim}

The aim of this project is to synthesize human singing with modifiable latent space parameters.

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build a functioning machine learning model that can synthesize human singing with modifiable latent space parameters (F0 and Z).
    \item Testing how accurate and adaptable the DDSP model is at synthesizing singing using several different inferencing tests.
    \item Derive constructive recommendations for future research based on past research and the results of this paper.
\end{enumerate}
