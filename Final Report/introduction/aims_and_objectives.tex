\section{Aim}

This thesis aims to synthesize realistic human singing using DDSP with adjustable latent space parameters.

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build a functioning machine learning model that can synthesize human singing with adjustable latent space parameters (F0 and Z).
    \item Testing how accurate and adaptable the DDSP model is at synthesizing singing using several different inferencing tests, these validate that any created model behaves in line with the original DDSP model\cite{OriginalDDSP}, and shows DDSP would be useful in future applications. They are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Almost identical resynthesis of the same song, using the same latent space parameters and using the same artist used in the model's training dataset
        \item Independent control of the latent parameters loudness and fundamental frequency (F0)
        \item Ensuring the words in model resynthesis is pronounced correctly (i.e. no babbling or other audible errors)
        \item Ensuring the model can be trained in a reasonable amount of time and inferred in at least real-time
    \end{itemize}
    \item Derive constructive recommendations for future research based on past research and the results of this paper.
\end{enumerate}
