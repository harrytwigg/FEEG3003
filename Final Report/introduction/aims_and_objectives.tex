\section{Aim}

What is the best deep learning architecture for synthesizing realistic musical vocals?

\section{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To evaluate existing approaches to vocal audio signal encoding and vocal sound synthesis using deep learning methods. Determining the best architecture for synthesizing realistic vocal features using a set technical and accademic evaluation criteria.
    \item Build on the best of the existing architecture for synthesizing singing using deep learning methods, validating and demonstrating the applicability of the proposed approach.
    \item Derive constructive reccomendations for future research based on past research and the results of this paper.
\end{enumerate}
