\chapter{An Investigation in Using DDSP to Learn and Synthesize Vocal Features}

The adaptation of DDSP to synthesize vocal features such as singing using the additional MFFC layer was chosen for further investigation.

All research was undertaken using Google Colab notebooks and cloud hardware, primarily NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.

It was hypothesized that 2 albums would be the optimal size for any training dataset. Premilinary investigations on smaller datasets yielded significant overfitting and poor performance when any of the F0, amplitude or Z latent encoding features were modified during inference. Datasets of any greater size would be preferred. However, the model size was limited as the whole model had to fit onto a single GPU, and Google Colab limited theze at 16GB. Any larger models would require parallisation which was not implemented.
