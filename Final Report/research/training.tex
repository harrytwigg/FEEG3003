\section{Training}

Two seperate models were trained, one for each of the datasets.

A preprocessor was used that resampled the fundamental frequency and loudness, taking account the sample rate, frame rate, and number of timesteps. The number of timesteps was set at 1000 per 4 second clip, giving a spectral resoluiton of 4ms per timestep. This was deemed to be the best compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy.

An autoencoder encoder decoder setup was used. The encoder was based on a \acrfull{RNN}.
