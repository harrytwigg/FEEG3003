\label{ch:other}

\section{Training Needs}

Extensive knowledge into how Machine Learning Models work, especially in relation
to audio signal processing is essential for this projects progression. This shall
be picked up in the initial research phase.

Being able to efficiently and accurately conduct a literary review is a skill that
must be applied especially in the early phases of the project. Further knowledge
of how to do this may be required.

Knowledge of how to access computing services shall be required potentially as the
project progressies (See Resource Access).

\section{Risk Assessment}

No specific risk assessments shall be required for this project, no access to labs
or other specialist equipment is required. The entirety of the project shall take
place digitally.

\section{Resource Access}

No purchasing of physical resources for the project shall be required. However,
it is likely that as the project progresses, access to Machine Learning optimised
computer systems shall be required (eg graphics processing units or tensor processing
units). This may take the form of access to the University's computing cluster.

Access to datasets eg. of preclassified information to feed into any machine learing
models shall be required.
